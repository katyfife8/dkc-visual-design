        <h1>Mockups</h1>
        <h2>Fonts, colours and icons</h2>
        <div class="image-summary">
          <p>I wanted the website to compliment the products and to reflect their simplicity, and thought about ways to
            achieve this visually. I felt a consistent user interface with breathing space around the different elements
            would contribute to a sense of calm, along with a fairly neutral colour palette.</p>

          <p>I looked at a variety of font pairings, settling on Lora and Roboto in combination. I opted for a
            serif and sans-serif pairing in an attempt to echo the timeless quality of the products, but also their
            relative minimalism. Lora is used for
            headings and hero text, with Roboto at different weights for the navigation, body text and calls to action.
            I experimented with more decorative serif fonts, but prioritised the legibility of headings.
            Navigation links and calls-to-action are in uppercase to give them a particular emphasis.
          </p>

          <p>The icons are sourced from FlatIcon. They aren’t entirely consistent in style – the burger icon lines for
            example, have a rounded cap, for example, and this was rectified when building the project.</p>

          <p>I experimented with the Adobe colour wheel before finding a theme I thought would work well. The contrast
            ratio of all combinations used has been checked for AA compliance using the TPGi Colour Contrast Analyser.
            The lighter blue is used for buttons, with the darker blue taking effect for hover and selected states.</p>

        <h2>Components and layout</h2>
        <div class="image-summary">
          <p>
            The mockups were created with Adobe XD. I used a 1920 x 1080px artboard for the desktop designs, but all
            content except
            the hero image sits within a width of 1280px to ensure it is comfortably placed within a 1366px browser
            window. The
            viewport height is set 768px. I used a twelve-column layout, with a 40px gutter to help me create the space
            desired between elements. I
            also used the Adobe XD square layout to support consistent spacing with a square size of eight – in general,
            component heights, margin
            sizes and font sizes are multiples of eight.
            I
            created my own UI kit of reusable components, including cards, buttons, forms and a header and footer. This
            aligned
            well with the modular, component-based build in React.</p>
          <p>

            The mobile artboards use the iPhone X template because I wanted to meet the
            challenge of a slimmer phone
            first. The row layout of cards converts to column for mobile and heading sizes are decreased. The paragraph
            font size remains at 16px regardless of browser size for an accessible reading experience.</p>
