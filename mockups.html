        <h1>Mockups</h1>
        <h2>Fonts, colour palette and icons</h2>
        <div class="image-summary">
          <p>I wanted the website to compliment the products and to reflect their simplicity, and thought about ways to
            achieve this visually. I felt a consistent user interface with breathing space around the different elements
            would contribute to a sense of calm, along with a fairly neutral colour palette.</p>

          <p>I looked at a variety of font pairings, settling on Lora and Roboto in combination. I opted for a
            serif and sans-serif pairing in an attempt to echo the timeless quality of the products, but also their
            relative minimalism. Lora is used for
            headings, with Roboto at different weights for the navigation, body text and calls to action. While taken
            with more decorative fonts, the site is designed to be functional and legibility is important.</p>

          <p>The icons are sourced from FlatIcon. They aren’t entirely consistent in style – the burger icon lines for
            example, have a rounded cap, for example, and this was rectified when building the project.</p>

          <p>I experimented with the Adobe colour wheel before finding a theme I thought would work well. The contrast
            ratio of all combinations used have been checked for AA compliance using the TPGi Colour Contrast Analyser.
            The darker blue is used for hover and selected states.</p>

        <h2>Artboards, components and layout</h2>
        <div class="image-summary">
          <p>
            The mockups were created with Adobe XD. I used a 1920x1080px artboard for desktop, but all content except
            the hero image sits within a width of 1280px to ensure it is comfortably placed within a 1366px browser. The
            viewport height is set 768px. The mobile artboards use the iPhone X template because I wanted to meet the
            challenge of a slimmer phone
            first.</p>


          <p>I used a twelve-column layout, with a 40px gutter to help me create the space desired between elements. I
            also used the Adobe XD square layout to support consistent spacing with a square size of eight – in general,
            component heights, margin
            sizes and font sizes are multiples of eight.
            I
            created my own UI kit of reusable components, including cards, buttons, forms and a header and footer. This
            aligned
            well with the modular, component-based build in React.
