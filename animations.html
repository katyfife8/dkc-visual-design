        <div class="image-summary">
          <p>I designed an animation to advertise a workshop. I sourced the image of a kintsugi bowl from a
            stock photography website and reduced the width to 1080px. I
            used 'Content-Aware Scale' to extend the height to 1080px. I then
            duplicated the layer. I selected each
            fragment
            of the bowl in turn using the
            quick select tool, outputting
            each
            to a new layer. I zoomed in to make the selection pixel-by-pixel to achieve the finish I wanted, and used
            the
            'smart radius' and 'decontaminate colors' features as well as contracting the edges by 2% in the select and
            mask properties. I was left with the base
            of the bowl, and used the spot healing brush tool on replace mode to
            recreate the background where parts of the bowl had been cut. I added layers for the advert heading,
            summary
            and logo. I created a 'kintsugi pattern' image from the bowl image separately and layered this on top of the
            text to
            create a
            clipping mask – giving the text its kintsugi effect for the final frame.</p>

          <p> I opened the timeline to create a frame animation and added a fragment, positioned using transform rotate,
            to
            each frame, so that they accumulate – the seventh frame is the bowl in its original form. The text, logo and
            kintsugi text effect are added over the course of the final frames. I set each to 0.5 seconds and the
            animation to loop once.

            I exported the image as a gif using 'Save for Web'. I reduced the colour paletter from 256 to 128 – I
            wanted
            to reduce the file size, but felt the gold's lustre was diminsihed with fewer colours than this.</p>

        <div class="image-summary">
          <p>Inspired by 'cinemagraphs' shared on our course, I was interested in making a smoother gif. This animation
            was
            conceived as an Instagram
            advert for the festive season and
            made by animating a still image, with the help of a <a
              href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQoeTbBHwuM">tutorial</a>. I found an image of a ceramic/glass
            candle on a stock photography website. I was drawn to the warmth of
            the image. The image was resized and then cropped to 1080 x 1080px. I placed the logo as a layer on the
            candle holder, coloured to match it. I then added a text box for the headline and offer text in the brand
            fonts, using the eyedropper tool to pick a text colour to match the candle's flame.</p>
          <p>I used the quick selection tool to select most of the flame element and saved this to a new layer, with a
            feather of one pixel to soften the edges. I used the paint brush tool, increasing the hardness to 50% and
            picking a colour from the flame itself
            using the eye dropper tool, and dabbed once over the candle flame to create a 'flame glow'. I set the
            blending mode to soft light.
            I then used the brush to dab each of the lights in the image’s background, with minor changes to the
            colour and opacity for
            each, and a blending mode of soft light.</p>
          <p>I created a four-second video animation within the timeline panel, with a resolution of 50% and loop
            playback. I
            selected the flame layer and added a number of keyframes at intervals, moving the flame layer up or down
            at each point. I copied the key frame at the start and pasted it to the end so that the loop's end-start
            transition is as smooth as possible. I then set up keyframe points for each of the layers – moving each
            'light glow' and changing the opacity at intervals. I wanted the text to 'flicker' with other elements of
            the image, so added keyframes to alter the opacity at intervals.</p>
          <p>Finally, I reduced the overall size to 800 x 800px and exported the image as a gif with 256 colours as I
            wanted to preserve as much of the image's colour variation as possible.</p>
          <p>I feel this animation would be greatly enhanced by audio of the crackle of a fire!</p>
