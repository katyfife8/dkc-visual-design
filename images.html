        <div class="image-summary">

          <p>I wanted to create a simple icon for the brand and thought the recognisable shape and symmetry of vases
            would work well. Two are incorporated in the brand logos, but I have also experimented with decorating them
            as standalone motifs.</p>

          <p>I sourced an image of three plain vases from a stock photography website and placed this as a template
            on a 1000 x 1000px canvas in Adobe Illustrator. To achieve the symetrical finish I
            wanted for the icons, I traced around the outline of one half of
            each vase using the curvature tool, joining the start and finish with a perfectly straight line down the
            centre. I filled the resulting shape with a solid colour – initially black to give the effect of a
            silhouette. I
            duplicated each half and used transform > reflect to mirror the object vertically at 90
            degrees. I merged the two sides of each vase, creating a single shape, using the shape builder tool. I
            coloured the vases and outlines using the palette I had chosen for the brand, and here they are also
            presented at a variety of sizes. To maintain the background transparency, each was logo exported as a PNG
            file – PNG-8
            was sufficient as these are flat, single-colour images.</p>

          <p>The 'glazed vase' was edited in Photoshop. I added the vase PNG as a layer over a
            close-up image of a ceramic glaze. I outlined the vase using the
            quick selection tool, adding the selection as a mask. I painted over the layer mask in black with the brush
            tool, revealing the background layer image. I flattened the image and repeated this process with two
            further
            glaze images used in the project.
          </p>
          <p>To create the kintsugi effect, I opened the vase PNG in Photoshop and duplicated the layer so I could edit
            it
            non-destructively. I drew the yellow cracks with the brush tool with the hardness set to 100%, before
            exporting the
            image as a PNG-8 file using 'Save for Web'.</p>

        <div class="image-summary">
          <p>I designed two logos for the brand, each using a vase motif and the fonts chosen for this project – more
            can
            be found on the font and colour choices in the mockups section. I wanted both logos to reflect the
            simplicity and
            timeless feel
            of the
            products themselves, while allowing some flexibility to experiment with colour.</p>

          <p>The rectangle logo is used in the website's navigation bar. For this reason, and because
            the brand is new, I thought it was important that it contain the brand name in full. I drew a rectangle
            500px wide on a new canvas using the rectangle tool and rounded the corners slightly.
            I
            added a text box for 'Dulwich Kiln'
            in Lora at 80pt. The text is bold and in uppercase, with the character spacing set to 120 in order to
            give the letters a little breathing space. I added a second text box beneath this for 'Ceramics' in Roboto
            at
            52pt – again, in uppercase and bold, with a more dramatic character spacing set at 800. Once I was happy
            with
            the spacing
            between the rows of text, I grouped these elements as a single unit and aligned the taller vase motif
            next to the text.
          </p>

          <p>The second logo is designed for use on products and artwork – like a stamp – and in the site footer.
            The
            design is an echo of a simple plate, and I experimented with 'imperfect' circles to mirror the rustic,
            handmade finish of the products. I didn't think the imperfection would appear manifestly deliberate,
            however,
            and I settled on perfect circles.</p>

          <p>I drew a circle with a width and height of 900px using the ellipse tool. I then created another circle with
            a width and height of 500px and centred this within the first circle. I adjusted the stroke of the inner
            circle to 8pt (though this matches the inner circle colour in most versions, so isn't visible). I added a
            text box for the initials ‘DK’. I was happy with the spacing between the letters, so kept the
            characters in a single text box, rather than separating them. I created a new text box for
            the word ‘Ceramics’ and placed this below the initials. Again, all text is capitalised. I wanted the DK
            to be significantly bigger (200pt) than ‘Ceramics’
            (40pt), but felt putting the latter in bold against the initials in a medium weight resulted in the best
            visual
            balance. ‘Ceramics’ also has a character spacing of 230. I grouped the text
            boxes
            and added the medium vase illustration to the logo, scaling it
            to an appropriate size. I then altered the plate, text and vase colour using combinations from chosen
            palettes and reduced the overall logo size to 500 x 500px for my purposes.</p>
          <p> I selected and grouped the
            objects comprising each logo, and chose to export it as a scalable vector graphic (SVG), attracted by the
            format's low file size
            and
            its
            scalability. I chose to convert the font to outlines in order to avoid font compatability issues, though
            understand this to increase the file size.</p>

        <div class="image-summary">
          <p>I created a hero image for the website's homepage with a maximum width of 1440px and a
            height of 768px to occupy the above-the-fold region on smaller desktop screens. The original image was
            sourced
            from a stock photography website. Many of the images used on the website
            are
            relatively light and muted and the contrast offered by this picture appealed to me – I felt it would add
            depth
            and
            drama to the page. The image's darkness also meant that the contrast ratio would be acceptable with
            off-white
            text overlaid.</p>

          <p>I created a 1920 x 1080px canvas in Photoshop to set a background for this template. I set ruler guides to
            mark out a centered, 1440px-wide region. I adjusted the levels of the original image to increase
            the
            contrast slightly,
            and increased the vibrance to +20 which brought out the bluer tone. I extended the image's
            background
            to the
            left to give it a landscape orientation using Photoshop's content-aware feature. However, the new
            background
            rendered
            wasn't of sufficient quality and I decided to apply a gradient overlay to overcome this. I moved the
            edited
            image to my template and used the transform tool to scale it to an appropriate size. I created an
            additional
            layer and filled this with the brand's 'off-black' colour (#0d0d0d). I added a layer mask and used the
            gradient tool to add a black-to-white gradient horizontally, using the shift key to ensure the angle of
            this was straight. I shifted the gradient layer to the desired position. I then created a layer under it
            with
            a plain block of colour at 90% opacity – this meets the gradient where it ends to the left
            of
            the image, giving a seamless finish. I cropped the image to its final width of 1440px. I used Export >
            Save
            for Web to save the image as a JPG at 'very high' quality. This reduced the file size from 'maximum' but
            retained the quality, which was important owing to the size and prominance of the image on the website.</p>

        <div class="image-summary">
          <p>The original product images were supplied by the ceramicist.</p>
          <p>The cup and saucer image I received was relatively small. I cropped it on the left-hand side so that the
            object is centered
            horizontally in the frame. I then created a number of adjustment layers to make changes to
            the image tone. I altered the levels by moving the black and white input sliders to map the pixel values
            to
            0 and 255 respectively, with the subsequent
            redistribution of levels increasing the contrast of the image.
            I increased the vibrance to +40, which had a subtle effect on the colour, with the brown pulled out a
            little more. I also increased the contrast to 15 and reduced the brightness to -10. I wanted to give the
            image more depth, and add emphasis to the branch shadows especially.</p>

          <p>I made similar adjustments to the levels and vibrance of the image of grey-brown cups, but I also
            wanted to
            soften the texture of the surface on which the cups are placed, so that the image is closer in style to
            stock images of ceramics I had sourced. I added a layer and used the eyedropper tool to match the surface
            colour, painting over the background with the brush tool with 0% hardness and 50% opacity.I reduced the
            opacity for the area around the cups in order to preserve the natural shadows. I reduced the image size to
            662px (the maximum width it will be displayed on the website) and
            also cropped the wall so that it does not distract from the objects.
          </p>
          <p>I exported the images at high quality using 'Save for Web'. The
            product images are used in square and 4x3 ratios on the website, but they are presented in the post-edit
            ratios here, to better show the effects of the adjustments.

            I created a promotional banner template for use on the website. The original image was sourced from a stock
            photograpy website. I reduced its height to 520px. I increased the width of the image to 1280px by extending
            the canvas to the left and
            dragged the image to cover this space using 'Content-Aware Scale'. It was an ideal image for this tool,
            thanks to the simplicity of the background. I added a white rectangle using the rectangle tool and
            positioned this as desired. I set removed the rectangle's border and set the opacity to 66%. I added a
            second rectangle, filled in the brand blue-grey to represent a button. I added the button's call to action
            and a heading and summary in text boxes, with my chosen fonts. I exported the image using 'Save for Web' at
            high quality.
          </p>

          <p>The Photoshop file contains an additional banner image made using a photograph provided by the artist. I
            selected the plate using the quick
            selection tool and added this as a mask. This allowed me to make adjustments to the plate alone, altering
            the levels and hue and increasing the saturation for the
            cyans. I also straitened the plate using the ruler. I thought the wooden surface of the original would be
            too
            dominant, so sourced and added a lighter wood background. I used the brush tool to paint a shadow for the
            plate on its new surface,
            in addition to a drop shadow effect. Ultimately, however, I was not sufficiently satisfied with the quality
            of
            this image to use it.

        <div class="image-summary">
          <p>I wanted to make an inviting composite image comprising various elements I had worked on. This image is
            for
            the ‘Studio’ page of the
            website. I sourced an image for the background featuring a table surface with a cup of coffee and reduced
            its width
            to
            800px which would meet requirements. I added a retouching layer and used the spot healing brush to remove
            the original cup
            of coffee, leaving a clear
            table surface. The saturation is upped slightly through an adjustment layer to increase the warmth of the
            wood colour.</p>

          <p>I found the background wood too austere, so sourced a separate image of floorboards, whose colour
            echoes the brand palette. I used transform to scale the new floorboards to a size proportionate to the
            table, rotating their angle to fit more realistically. I reduced the opacity of
            the new floor layer to 60% so that it serves as a semi-opaque overlay on the original wood for a more
            natural
            finish.
          </p>

          <p>The original plates image was from the artist. I used the spot healing tool to retouch a mark along the
            side of
            the top plate. The plates were selected using the quick selection tool. In the select and mask properties, I
            increased the edge smoothness to 30, the contrast to 10% and shifted the edge by 25% to give the selection a
            more
            realistic finish.
            After placing them on the table, I used the transform tool to size the plates appropriately and the distort
            mode
            to
            ‘flatten’ them at a natural angle when seen from above.</p>

          <p>I created a simple postcard in Photoshop using a stock image and resized and positioned this using the
            move
            and transform scale and rotate tools. The opacity is reduced to 90% to make it look less ‘stuck on’ and I
            added
            drop and inner shadow effects to make the card look less flat and more life-like.</p>

          <p>Finally I sourced an image of a ‘plain’ cup of coffee, without a motif in the foam – I found this
            surprisingly
            difficult! I selected this using the quick selection tool, and placed the selection as a layer over the
            table.
            The plates and coffee were
            positioned so that the light and shadows fall in the same position relative to the objects. I created a
            simplified version of the round logo, resized it and placed it over the coffee portion of the cup to use
            as
            a template, with a blend mode of 'screen'. I created a
            duplicate layer and used the smudge tool, at varying sizes and a strength of 100%, to recreate a coffee
            foam
            effect over the letters and vase.</p>

          <p>I exported the image at high quality using 'Save for Web'.</p>
